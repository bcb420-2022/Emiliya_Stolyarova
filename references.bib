abstract = {Summary
The remarkable cellular and genetic heterogeneity of soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) limits the clinical benefit of targeted therapies. Here, we show that expression of the gluconeogenic isozyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 2 (FBP2) is silenced in a broad spectrum of sarcoma subtypes, revealing an apparent common metabolic feature shared by diverse STSs. Enforced FBP2 expression inhibits sarcoma cell and tumor growth through two distinct mechanisms. First, cytosolic FBP2 antagonizes elevated glycolysis associated with the “Warburg effect,” thereby inhibiting sarcoma cell proliferation. Second, nuclear-localized FBP2 restrains mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration in a catalytic-activity-independent manner by inhibiting the expression of nuclear respiratory factor and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). Specifically, nuclear FBP2 colocalizes with the c-Myc transcription factor at the TFAM locus and represses c-Myc-dependent TFAM expression. This unique dual function of FBP2 provides a rationale for its selective suppression in STSs, identifying a potential metabolic vulnerability of this malignancy and possible therapeutic target.}

We create detailed and comprehensive annotation of gene structures, regulatory elements and variants, and enable comparative genomics by inferring the evolutionary history of genes and genomes. Our integrated genomic data are made available in a variety of ways, including genome browsers, search interfaces, specialist tools such as the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor, download files and programmatic interfaces. Here, we present recent Ensembl developments including two new website portals. Ensembl Rapid Release (http://rapid.ensembl.org) is designed to provide core tools and services for genomes as soon as possible and has been deployed to support large biodiversity sequencing projects. Our SARS-CoV-2 genome browser (https://covid-19.ensembl.org) integrates our own annotation with publicly available genomic data from numerous sources to facilitate the use of genomics in the international scientific response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also report on other updates to our annotation resources, tools and services. All Ensembl data and software are freely available without restriction.}",

We have developed GEOmetadb in an attempt to make querying the GEO metadata both easier and more powerful. All GEO metadata records as well as the relationships between them are parsed and stored in a local MySQL database. A powerful, flexible web search interface with several convenient utilities provides query capabilities not available via NCBI tools. In addition, a Bioconductor package, GEOmetadb that utilizes a SQLite export of the entire GEOmetadb database is also available, rendering the entire GEO database accessible with full power of SQL-based queries from within R.},
